There once was a boy named Justin. He played ps4 a lot, until one day his ps4 broke. Justin doesn't play anymore.

Justin then decided to buy an xbox. He was very frustrated with his ps4, and thought maybe this console wouldn't break. Justin now plays video games regularly. 

Justin invites his friends to his house to play video games every weekend. Whenever they are hungry, they order delivery. They forgot to give tips yesterday, and the driver was not happy.

Today, they ordered again. This time still no tips.

But this time the delivery driver was so outraged that he said something. He yelled at Justin and his friends for a  good twenty minutes about the proper tipping etiuette.
